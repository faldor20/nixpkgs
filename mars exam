Aquaculture is likely to play key role in allowing humanity to continue to expand and grow in a way that is environmentally friendly and resource efficient.

Aquacultre can take on many forms and be used as a tool in solving an impressive range of problems we humans face, from producing enough food to feed the steadily growing population with ever higher demands for protein and luxury foods like meats, to allowing sustainable and resource efficient production of previously non-renewable resources in the form of biofuels and polymers.

However this fast growing tool has certainly had some serious growing pains, aquaculture, particularly marine aquaculture has a serious image problem, and rightly so. Marine aquaculture, is good for environment in so far as it reduces strain on already over fished oceans and does produce protein in a way that is far far more resource efficient than land based meat sources such as cattle, which require comparatively huge amounts of both water and feed to produce an equal amount of end product meat. However many existing, and almost all past implementations of marine aquaculture systems have also had very real negative environmental impacts.

The primary one being pollution, pollution in a wide array of different forms:

Environmental pollution:

The process of feeding farmed fish is a very inefficient one, it means dumping large amounts of feed into the water in which the fish are contained, much of which will go uneaten and spill into the surrounding environment, this excess of nutrients can cause eutrophication and algal blooms, and also potentially introduce foreign chemicals such as the antibiotics fed to the fish to reduce disease. The fish themselves, when contained in such large quantities in such small spaces also produce an inordinate amount of waste, which has often been poorly managed and just like the escaped feed also causes eutrophication and dead zones in waters it contaminates.

Genetic pollution:

Escaped farmed marine species can pollute the gene-pool with genetics bred specifically for farmed domesticated life, this can lead to genetic weaknesses in the wider population.

Species pollution:

Often the fish farmed are not native to the environment they are farmed in, escaped fish are alien species that can potential outcompete local marine species and cause widespread disruption in the local foodchain. This is a particular problem with benthic species like bivalves that spawn into the water column and are almost impossible to contain.

So, how can marine aquaculture, an industry with such a tainted history seem to have such a promising future?

Many of the problems caused by aquaculture come from approaching it like traditional farming, one huge monoculture contained in an extremely small space, with food carted in, and waste often carted away. Marine ecosystems are inherently so interconnected that such an approach is always going to be inefficient and environmentally taxing. The marine aquaculture of the future proposes to use a more integrated system where much of the waste is dealt with and some of the feed is provided by the internal environment of the farm. Not only does the decrease environmental impact, it also generates more useable products and requires less outside inputs and so has less contact with the outside environment.

How do we achieve this connected design?

By leveraging a better understanding of existing marine ecosystems we can design aquaculture systems that incorporate the naturally occurring methods of dealing with waste and providing food. Referred to as IMTA or integrated multi-trophic environments. This involves incorporating sea-weeds and filter feeders like bivalves into your aquaculture to deal with waste and clean water. Incorporating fish like talapia that naturally feed on extremely easy to grow algaes. Using detrovores like sea cucumbers and mullet to clean up feed that falls to the bottom. In the center of this you an put a high value meat eating fish like salmon. each of these elements is either harvested for its own sake such as the salmon and perhaps the seaweed and bivalves or feed back into the system, the algae eating fish like talapia could be fed to salmon and the seaweed fed to those fish. These techniques would allow creating completely separated farms where there is zero ability for nutrient, waste, or introduced spices to escape into the surrounding environment and allow the production of sustainable, highly efficient environmentally conscious protein for all. These techniques have been used in the rice patties of Asia with Tilapia for hundreds of years and bivalves and algeas are already being used to sustainably generate food and improve water quality all around the world. The future of marine aquaculture can be clean and efficient all thanks to emulating the ecosystems that had already solved these problems for millions of years.



# When you go exploring on a rocky shore and find an invertebrate animal that is unfamiliar to you, what one feature would help you to immediately decide whether it is most likely to be an active predator or a passive suspension feeder, and why?

Whether or not it is mobile, to actively hunt a creature must be able to move in one way or another. We would expect suspension feeders to be permanent or semi-permanently attached to rocks whereas an active predator must be able to move to find new sources of food.

# Non-bioluminescent countershading is common in fish that live in the epipelagic zone, but less common in fish of the mesopelagic zone. Why?

This is because there is very little sunlight in the mesopelagic zone. In the epipelagic zone however, light from the sun will mean the the ocean above will appear brighter than the ocean below. this means that fish with darker tops will blend with the dark ocean below and lighter bellies will blend with the lighter ocean above creating a camouflage effect that is useful to both predators and prey. This is particularly noticeable on sharks

# Severe coastal inundation and erosion usually occurs when many oceanographic factors work in concert to create dangerous nearshore conditions for coastal infrastructure and ecosystems. What are these factors and how will climate change affect the risk of inundation and erosion in the coastal zone?

The most severe erosion is caused when a high tide is combined with a storm. this creates an effect called storm surge, where the low pressure system actually increases the water level, and the storms winds create greater wave action. This causes extremely high waves that can breach over the beach and then water can inundate the land behind the beach, this can take huge amounts of sand away and cause massive infastructure damage.

# What are the main approaches for mapping the seafloor and what are the limitations for these different approaches?  



Satellites, depth sounding from boats and lidar from planes. Satellites and lidar are both limited in the depth of water they work in and are heavily effected by water quality, especially lidar, because of its use of lasers which must penetrate through the water. Depth sounding doesn't suffer from these problems but can only be done at a much slower pace because it can really only detect a small area under the hull of a boat. lidar is exceedingly accurate and

However many existing, and almost all past implementations of marine aquaculture systems, mostly focused on producing big ticket food like fin fish have also had very real negative environmental impacts.

So, how can marine aquaculture, an industry with such a tainted history seem to have such a promising future?

Many of the problems caused by aquaculture come from approaching it like traditional farming, one huge monoculture, usually high value and desirable fin fish, contained in an extremely small space, with food carted in, and waste often carted away. This is not the only approach, and fin fish are not the only marine species worth cultivating. Bivalves like shellfish and algaes like seaweed are both able to be grown without significant input from outside sources, they are filter feeders and naturally thrive in the super high nutrient eutrophic waters that are actually created by fin fish farming and the problematic nutrient runoff from land based agriculture. Because algae and bivalves like shellfish get their nutrients from particulate floating in the water column they actually serve to clean and filter the water they grow in instead of dirtying it with uneaten feed and waste, Some bivalves can reach filtration rates of 17 liters of sea water per day per shellfish. Studies have shown potential for using bivalves to cleanup dirty and polluted waters around cities and bays, reclaim nutrients lost from farms as runoff, and even enhance local production of higher value finfish and crustaceans. Additional, thanks to shellfish and seaweed being at almost the bottom of the food chain they are able to produce a huge amount of usable food for the amount of nutrients put into the system they live in, this also makes them exceedingly space efficient, with some estimates claiming an area the size of Washington USA made up of combined bivalve algae aquaculture could provide all the nutrients needed to feed the entire global population.

As mentioned, bivalves are unfortunately almost impossible to contain because they spawn into the water column, thankfully almost everywhere on earth has some native species of bivalve that can be farmed, this both increases the variety of food available globally and also ensures the local ecosystem will be minimally impacted. The problem of farm bred bivalves genetically contaminating the outside environment is real and must be well monitored, however many of the traits we select for in bivalves are not all that different to natural ones, size, growth speed, and filtering rate, so the genetic changes due to domestication may be fairly harmless, it is certainly an area of concern though.


How can we use the fabulous advantages of bivalves and algaes to advance modern aquaculture ?

Bivalves and algaes can be and are being deployed in bays and oceans around the globe in small and large installations providing valuable industry as well as an environmental service cleaning our marine waters. People however don't all want to eat shellfish and seaweed, fin fish will likely always be very desirable to the public and so their framing is only going to increase, however the algae and bivalves can provide significant value in that area as well.

By leveraging a better understanding of existing marine ecosystems we can design fin fish aquaculture systems that incorporate these naturally occurring methods of dealing with waste and providing food. Referred to as IMTA or integrated multi-trophic environments. This involves incorporating sea-weeds and filter feeders like bivalves into current aquaculture to deal with waste and clean water. Allowing you to continue to grow high value desirable meat eating fish like salmon while containing their environmental impact. These techniques would allow creating completely separated farms where there is zero ability for nutrient, waste, or introduced species to escape into the surrounding environment and allow the production of sustainable, highly efficient environmentally conscious protein. These techniques have been used in a primitive way in the rice patties of Asia with Tilapia for hundreds of years and bivalves and algaes are already being used to sustainably generate food and improve water quality all around the world. There is a future where marine aquaculture actually improves the quality of water it is performed in, produces healthy disease free animals, reduces eutrophication and dead-zones, and actually makes the environment more habitable to local wild marine animals, and more beautiful for humans to enjoy.


#The abundance and diversity of hard corals tends to peak between 5 to 20 m depth on the outer reef slope, where there is access to both sunlight and currents. Why are both of these things important to coral growth?
Sunlight and currents are both important to corals because of their unusual dual-feeding style. The corals microbial symbiont photosynthesis sunlight and co2 into usable energy and the coral itself filter feeds. The microbial symbiont needs sunlight to photosynthesize and the coral needs water currents to transport food particles such as phytoplankton to it.
# Roseobacter is often associated with phytoplankton blooms such as the one visible in the satellite image above left. Using the figure above right as a guide, explain how the presence of Roseobacter can aid carbon sequestration in the deep sea.
Phytoplankton are part of the biological carbon cycle known as the biological pump, this is the process by which carbon and nutrients move toward the deep sea and ocean floor, with some of it being made biavailable and returned to surface waters. The phytoplankton contribute to this process by photosynthesizing and absorbing carbon dioxide from the carbon and oxygen and sunlight rich waters close to the air-sea exchange. These phytoplankton either die or are broken apart when consumed and become dissolved or particulate organic matter. This matter sinks slowly to the deep waters, along the way it is processed and made more bioavailable by microbes which form the microbial carbon pump. Some of this matter sinks all the way to the sea floor where the carbon is stored almost indefinitely in the sea-floor sludge.
# A wave propagating towards the coast undergoes many changes as it enters shallow water. Describe the transformation of wave height and shape as it moves from deep to shallow water and the kind of wave breaking you are likely to observe.
Waves start as deep-water waves,which have a kind of pure, curved sinusoidal shape with no interaction with the sea floor, this occurs when the depth of the water is greater than half of the wavelength of the wave.  As the waves move into shallower waters where the bottom is closer than half the wavelength the waves water starts to interact with the bottom and the tips start to form sharp peaks and troughs flatten out. Once the waves are in shallow water -depth less than 1/20th of the wavelength- the waves tips can no longer support themselves and they start to curl over and break.
#Explain the role of the Southern Ocean and Antarctica in the global thermohaline circulation. 
The southern ocean and Antarctica act as a kind of mixing transfer point for all the waters in the various other ocean basins, this is because it is the only area on earth where all the oceans join as one, unobstructed by any landmass. It is also one of the coldest points on earth and so it is the place where warm water from all other basins circulates to and where cold highly saline water is able to leave from back to those other oceans.
